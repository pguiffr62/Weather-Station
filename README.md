# DIY Weather Station:
Created By Lily Wielar and Piper Guiffre

## Project Planning:

### Goal
Our goal is to create a weather station for Charlottesville High School that will be able to measure the conditions of the area at the school to compare to National weather forecasts for the Charlottesville area. Our finished project will waterproofed and will be powered by the school wind turbine. We will collect data for temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, air pressure, and rain fall. All data will be uploaded as raw data and condensed data in the form of graphs and tables to the internet. We want to finish our project in a timely manner and ensure that it is competitive with other weather stations on sites such as Amazon. 

### Criteria
Criteria are a list of measurable sub goals, things you must achieve.
1. Make instruction manual to maintain product
2. Look up maintenance of products
3. Connect the data from station to larger hub that connects with other stations
4. Have station upload and store data 
5. Find location for weather station
6. Create a Weather proof box 

### Constraints
Constraints are a list of limitations or factor you must consider, in order to be sucessful
The tradition 3 constraints are time, budget, and safety
1. Our budhet is $~~~
2. We must be done by Febuary 2020
3. We need to learn how to 
4. The maximum size we can laser cut is ____ and the biggest 3d print is 8"x8"x8"
5. How can we make sure this is useable by future students?
      - by creating a usable interface were data is convienently and clearly stored and avilible

### Materials 
1. Espressif esp32-wroom-32
2. Waterproof housing
3. Adafruits Waterproof DS18B20 Digital temperature 
4. Anemometer Wind Speed Sensor w/Analog Voltage Output
5. Rain gauge [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.weathershack.com/product/rainwise-rainew211.html)
6. All-in-one [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660) 

### Project Features
1. Temperature
2. Ground temperature
3. Humidity
4. Rainfall 
5. Air quality 
6. Wifi
7. Website that uploads and stores data over time via wifi 
8. Connects to larger global network
