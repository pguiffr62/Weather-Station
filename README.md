# DIY Weather Station:
Created By Lily Wielar and Piper Guiffre

## GOAL:
Our goal is to create a weather station for Charlottesville High School that will be able to measure the conditions of the area at the school to compare to National weather forecasts for the Charlottesville area. Our finished project will waterproofed and will be powered by the school wind turbine. We will collect data for temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, air pressure, and rain fall. All data will be uploaded as raw data and condensed data in the form of graphs and tables to the internet. We want to finish our project in a timely manner and ensure that it is competitive with other weather stations on sites such as Amazon. 
## TIMELINE:
#### November 15th: Completed expert Circuit Python assignments on canvas
#### November 20th: Have all materials finalized and ordered
#### November 22nd: Update original plan with more detail on how to create a complete waterproofed weather station AND meet with lady
#### November 29th: Temperature wiring and code
#### December 6th: Humidity wiring and code
#### December 13th: Air pressure wiring and code 
#### December 20th: Wind speed wiring and code
#### January 10th: Wire all materials and weather apparatus individually. Ensure that they all work and create code to use each of them AND make sure wifi works 
#### January 17th: Finish Solidwork pieces needed for weather station
#### January 24th: Have our system wired
#### January 31st: Have code finalized
#### February 1st: Our project is completed
#### February 1st-7th: Troubleshooting any problems
